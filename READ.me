An online shopping website built as part of a school project. It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, leave feedback, and contact the shop.

Hosted on Netlify with JSON API served via Render.

## Problem Statement

Shopping for electronics and accessories online is often **confusing** due to cluttered websites, limited accessibility, and lack of simple cart/feedback options.

## Solution

We created a **clean, responsive online shop** that:

* Displays products (phone, laptop, headphones, etc.)
* Lets users add/remove items from a cart
* Has a feedback & contact form
* Is easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile
